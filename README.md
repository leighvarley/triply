WDI Project 2: Triply

User Stories
As a user I should be able to:
-create an account
-log in
-view all recommendations for a specific location
-view a specific recommendation for a specific location
-create a new recommendation for a specific location
-edit a specific recommendation that I created
-delete a specific recommendation that I created
-create a new comment on an existing recommendation
-delete a comment that I created

Big picture project idea: 
The big picture idea for this project is a social network for travelers. Users will create profiles that they can use as a travel journal. They'll be able to save trip itineraries, record memories, and upload photos and videos. Users will connect with their friends and family on the site and view other users' profiles for travel inspiration and tips. Users who travel together will be able to collaborate on a page about their trip where they can store all of their photos, videos, and memories.

Project two chuck of the idea:
For project two, I will tackle the chuck of this project that allows users to log in and create recommendations and comments on cities.

Project inspiration: This idea stems from a personal desire for such a service. Whenever I am planning a trip, I like to ask around to see if any of my friends or family members have visited the location where I am going as I trust their options more than I trust those of folks of Trip Advisor, etc., who I might not have much in common with. It would be really cool to see my friend and family's favorite places and trip photos all in one place. It would also be really cool to be able to collaborate with people I traveled with to create a shared page with memories and photos from our trip. I know that there are photo sharing services out there, but I don't know of anything that combines photo sharing with narrative for a more complete collaborate story. When I was a kid, my mom kept a travel journal that she made everyone write in that travelled with her. It was a bit of a pain at the time, but it is so cool to look back on now and to see how I experienced a trip as a seven year old and how others on the same trip had different experiences or different memories. I'd like to make a tool that tells the complete story of a trip and allows users to share these experiences with those in their network.

I would really like to go over this ERD with an instructor before I get too far on the project. I think that I would know what to do if I just had users, recommendations, and comments, but working location into the mix threw me off a bit and I'm not sure if I've set things up correctly.
