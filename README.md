WDI Project 2: Triply

User Stories
As a user I should be able to:
-create an account
-log in
-view all recommendations for a specific location
-view a specific recommendation for a specific location
-create a new recommendation for a specific location
-edit a specific recommendation that I created
-delete a specific recommendation that I created


Project two:
For project two, I will create users and allow them to log in and to create, read, update and delete recommendations. I will add comments if I have time.

Eventually, I would like to create a social network for travellers where users can create profiles and connect with their frinds and family to share travel advice. I would also like to create features that allow users to share photos, tag their posts, store trip itenaries, and more.

I would really like to go over this ERD with an instructor before I get too far on the project. I think that I would know what to do if I just had users, recommendations, and comments, but working location into the mix threw me off a bit and I'm not sure if I've set things up correctly.
