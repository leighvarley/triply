WDI Project 2: Triply

User Stories
As a user I should be able to:
-create an account
-log in
-view all recommendations for a specific location
-view a specific recommendation for a specific location
-create a new recommendation for a specific location
-edit a specific recommendation that I created
-delete a specific recommendation that I created


Eventually, I would like to expand this project into a social network for travelers where users can create profiles and connect with their friends and family to share travel advice. I would also like to create features that allow users to share photos, tag their recommendations, store trip itineraries, comment on exiting recommendations, and more.
