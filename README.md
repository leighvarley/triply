WDI Project 2: Triply

User Stories
As a user I should be able to:

-create an account

-log in

-view all locations

-view all recommendations for a specific location

-view a specific recommendation for a specific location

-create a new recommendation for a specific location

-edit a specific recommendation that I created

-delete a specific recommendation that I created

-create a new comment on an existing recommendation

-delete a comment that I created


The purpose of this site is to create a social netwok for travellers. The site will function somewhat like Tripadvisor, but instead of receiving recommendations from the general public, users will only receive recommendations from their trusted network of friends, family members, and acquaintances who they are connected to on Triply. This will provide more reliable and tailored travel advice.

The fist set will be to create users and to allow them to log in and make recommendations. Next, I will create user profiles and comments and allow users to connect with one another. Eventally I will add in a journal/blog feature where users can record trip memories and save photos and videos from their trip. Users will be able to collaborate with other users who travelled with them so that they can store all trip photos, videos, and journal entries in one location. I will also add additional style features such as drop down menus and tagging features.

I would really like to go over this ERD with an instructor before I get too far on the project. I think that I would know what to do if I just had users, recommendations, and comments, but working location into the mix threw me off a bit and I'm not sure if I've set things up correctly.
